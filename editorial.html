                <p>Anne Brontë's poetry comprises a body of approximately fifty surviving poems with
                    a broad range of topics, genre and forms. Her Gondal project begins as fantasy
                    juvenilia written with her sister Emily and this imaginative escapism is adapted
                    as a vehicle to explore more complex existential matters in later Gondal poems.
                    Brontë's non-Gondal poems include dialogue poems that engage in increasingly
                    nuanced intellectual and aesthetic debates, as well as meditations on faith,
                    family, and loneliness. Yet this rich oeuvre has rarely been the topic of
                    serious critical attention and gaining access to the poems themselves can prove
                    challenging. A selection of Brontë's poems were published in the compilation
                    volume <em>Poems by Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell</em> which was written and
                    submitted by all three Brontë sisters and published by Aylott & Jones in 1846.
                    However, the remainder of Brontë’s poems were still unpublished before her
                    premature death in 1849, meaning that readers have had to rely on other
                    editorial mediations when reading many of her poems. Moreover, there are many
                    interesting facets of Brontë's authorial process and intellectual positioning
                    which can be illuminated by a close focus on the manuscripts. Therefore, a
                    central element of my PhD project has been to create a digital scholarly edition
                    of a selection of Anne Brontë's poetry.</p>
                <p>Within my thesis, my focus is on Brontë's handling of themes of childhood,
                    pedagogy and Romanticism across her work. When it comes to her poetry, there are
                    ten poems which speak to these themes most productively and form the backbone of
                    my argument. I selected these ten poems for my edition to provide thematic
                    cohesion for the edition and editorial insights for the thesis. Encountering a
                    poem in a manuscript creates an entirely different sense of the nature and
                    personality of the poem. This more unfiltered sense of the poet's process and
                    the deliberate crafting of the poem can often be enhanced with alterations being
                    made to the poem in the manuscripts which are not conveyed as forcefully to the
                    reader by a footnote in a printed text. Therefore, providing the user with
                    access to the digital facsimiles of the manuscript materials is a central
                    element of my edition. While this can be achieved through a print edition with
                    facing pages of the manuscript and a transcription, a digital edition offers the
                    possibility to visualise facsimile images of the manuscript and to view
                    different versions of the poem which have appeared in print. The decision to
                    make the edition a digital one was therefore borne out of the desire to create
                    an easily accessible, reliable, and informative edition of the texts which
                    provides the user with the opportunity to view the manuscript directly alongside
                    a layer of editorial analysis of these poems and their textual history. Until
                    the release of the second edition of Edward Chitham's carefully complied <em>The
                        Poems of Anne Brontë</em> in early 2021 (coinciding with Brontë's
                    bicentenary celebrations), there had been no easy way to access a reliable
                    scholarly edition of Brontë's poems - Chitham's original 1979 edition had gone
                    out of print, meaning modern readers would have been reliant on historical
                    reprints of older, and potentially unverified versions of her work if they had
                    an interest in reading or studying the poetry. Therefore, these barriers to
                    accessing Anne Brontë's poetry, particularly in comparison to other Brontë
                    texts, reinforces the habitual minimisation of Brontë as a poet. The recent
                    republication of Chitham's text combined with the uptick in popular and
                    scholarly interest in Anne Brontë in recent years indicate an increased appetite
                    for this aspect of Brontë's work, making a digital edition of Brontë's poems
                    rather timely. Moreover, the edition will be freely available to all, providing
                    immediate access to a unique selection of Brontë's poems which are physically
                    separated by the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
                <p>I decided to create both a documentary and a critical edition of the selected
                    poems that the viewer can freely move between. The documentary edition provides
                    a diplomatic transcription of the text of each poem as found in the manuscript.
                    This transcription then forms the base text from which I built the text of the
                    critical edition. For the critical edition I provide the variations found in the
                    poems which were published in the 1846 <em>Poems by Currer, Ellis and Acton
                        Bell</em>, as well as providing editorial context and commentary which help
                    to elucidate the poems and their textual states for users. The combination of
                    both editions gives users the opportunity to read the more stripped back
                    documentary edition with its focus on the manuscript and to go to the critical
                    edition for more information on the poem's textual history and editorial
                    analysis. All of these elements, and the editorial processes which enacted them,
                    provided crucial support to my understanding of Brontë's intellectual and
                    philosophical positioning within her work.</p>
                <h4>Background</h4>
                <p>Digital editions are considered "a key interest in the Digital Humanities"
                    (Franzini et al. 2), with the field encompassing a wide range of divergent
                    approaches to textual editing. An umbrella definition of digital textual
                    editions as "projects that make use of digital technologies to reproduce
                    editions and transcriptions of literary texts, be those inscribed on tablets or
                    penned on papyrus, vellum, or paper" (2) is a useful starting point. Franzini et
                    al. also describe some of the key distinguishing features of different types of
                    digital textual editions:</p>
                <pre class="code-block">
[s]cholars distinguish between digital and digitised editions, the former indicating interactivity as opposed to mere reproductions of analogue 
material, and between digital editions and digital scholarly editions, the latter describing a project with a strong critical component 
(Franzini et.al 2).</pre>
                <p>My edition is digital as it is not simply a digitised version of an existing text
                    but rather comprises a discrete and unique digital text. Moreover, the edition
                    is interactive, providing the user with the full-texts of the selected versions
                    of each poem, allowing them to navigate between different views of each poem.
                    The interactive aspect of the edition further confirms that the edition is
                    digital rather than digitised. The question of a digital edition versus a
                    digital scholarly edition is a little more complex and gets to the heart of the
                    editorial process being followed here.</p>
                <p>This edition is most interested in the manuscript version of Brontë's texts and
                    the poems chosen here only exist in one manuscript version, meaning that options
                    for editorial approaches are automatically narrowed. When choosing between a
                    documentary edition or a more curated approach, there are some interesting
                    arguments to consider. Elena Pierazzo notes that the documentary edition which
                    "puts documents at the heart of the editorial care" (74) is generally considered
                    more relevant when dealing with one witness (76) but that there has also been
                    some snobbery around this approach meaning that, in practice, "there is a sort
                    of critical edition [which] has traditionally still been provided even in texts
                    surviving in a single witness, with the provision of a clear text, with internal
                    variations and apparent errors set aside" (76-7). The latter is a very accurate
                    description of Chitham's approach, which focuses on providing a clear reading
                    text of the manuscript, albeit with some editorial emendations. This choice
                    partly stems from the conventions of the print form; it would probably be rather
                    startling to many readers to pick up a book of Victorian poetry and find some
                    poems in tiny unpunctuated blocks, not to mention decidedly challenging to
                    read.</p>
                <p>The digital nature of this edition also comes into play when considering the
                    usability of a documentary edition. A documentary edition may not be the
                    preferred choice for a print edition as irregularities in presentation may be
                    jarring to the reader in that conventional context. By contrast, the digital
                    medium provides many more options in terms of form. Therefore, the potential to
                    view an image of the manuscript alongside a transcription gives the user a new
                    relationship to the form in which the text was first instantiated. This
                    encourages the user to view and engage with the physical attributes of the
                    original MS version of the text alongside providing an easily readable
                    transcription of the poem with some extra-textual history and other editorial
                    materials for those who are interested. Pierazzo suggests that it is this
                    ability to get close to the MS in a readable way which contributes to the
                    rehabilitation of the documentary edition in the context of the rising
                    popularity of digital scholarly editing (75), saying that "text encoding has in
                    fact enabled editors to have their cake and eat it: features that were once
                    normalized without mercy to produce reading, critical (or syntagmatic) editions,
                    can now be retained and simply switched on and off at the leisure to please
                    different types of audiences" (81). Pierazzo also notes that some users,
                    encountering the digital documentary edition of Jane Austen's work, were
                    "shocked" (77) because they were "not used to being exposed to the messiness of
                    the authorial work" (77), particularly in an author they expected to be very
                    well-organised and clean. This shock, in itself, can be valuable, as it means
                    that the user is being put in a position to reconfigure their preconceptions
                    about the author and/or the text due to their exposure to the less polished
                    texts that are common features of authors’ drafting and writing processes.</p>
                <p>This edition as a whole is a digital scholarly edition with the critical version
                    featuring additional components which are intended to bring the user’s
                    experience into a broader critical realm than the documentary option. Peter
                    Robinson notes the tension between encoding the text primarily as 'text-as-work'
                    versus 'text-as document' in the emerging debates about digital editions,
                    suggesting that many documentary style digital editions that prioritise
                    'text-as-document' offer little to no way into the edition except on a page by
                    page basis thus excluding "the possibility of recording text-as-work" (126).
                    Robinson further sees this method as one that risks "distanc[ing] ourselves and
                    our editions from the readers" (127) and contends that it is also worthwhile to
                    make the most of the fact that the "digital medium is perfectly adapted to
                    enactment of editions as an ever-continuing negotiation between editors,
                    readers, documents, texts and works" (127), making the case for expansive
                    digital scholarly editions. The first choice which brings the edition in this
                    direction is the inclusion of the texts which appear in the 1846 Poems which the
                    user can easily swap between or compare. Whereas later publications have been
                    edited by other hands, Brontë's alterations to the 1846 versions of the text
                    have more to insights to offer on Brontë's philosophical and aesthetic choices.
                    Furthermore, there is an additional layer of editorial annotations for the user
                    to engage with, including in text notes and individual editor’s notes featuring
                    textual history and analytical material.</p>
                <p>The edition consists of a selection of 10 of Brontë's poems. At a later date this
                    project might be expanded to include the full 52 poems by Brontë; however, this
                    scope was appropriate for the current project and the limited number gives the
                    opportunity for all relevant versions of the poems to be included in full, with
                    space for detailed editorial annotation and analysis. The poems were chosen
                    based on their relevance to my written thesis's focus on the representation of
                    childhood and pedagogy in Brontë's oeuvre. This gives the selection of poems in
                    the edition a thematic coherence so that the user can see connections and
                    development between the texts in terms of features such as Romantic imagery,
                    parent-child relationships and nostalgia. Moreover, this focus allows the
                    textual editing work to directly impact on my thesis work, as manuscript
                    information comes to light which casts more light on Brontë's approach to these
                    ideas.</p>
                <h4>Creating the edition</h4>
                <p>When considering the best methodological approach to take when constructing the
                    edition the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) was one of the primary options to
                    investigate. The TEI defines itself as:</p>
                <pre class="code-block">
a consortium which collectively develops and maintains a standard for the representation of texts in digital form. Its chief deliverable is 
a set of Guidelines which specify encoding methods for machine-readable texts, chiefly in the humanities, social sciences and linguistics 
(TEI "Home").</pre>
                <p>Moreover, the TEI is among the most frequently used encoding standards for
                    humanities texts - in Franzini et al.'s study, 56% of digital editions
                    considered used TEI-based XML files (16) and Georg Rhem describes it as "[o]ne
                    of the most widely used annotation systems in Linguistics and Digital
                    Humanities" (301). Using a well-established academic standard ensures high
                    levels of interoperability and reusability, as well as compatibility with a wide
                    range of visualisation software options. This choice is further supported by the
                    idea that "[e]ditors especially advocate this practice as a suitable means of
                    marking up and publishing texts online" (Franzini et al. 16). Moreover, Robinson
                    notes that "the Text Encoding Initiative guidelines have long offered
                    comprehensive means of encoding text-as-work… as well as the recently developed
                    system for encoding text-as-document" (124) meaning that the software is
                    well-suited to producing both the documentary and critical transcriptions of the
                    poems. In order to encode the poems using the TEI encoding language I decided to
                    use Oxygen XML Editor.</p>
                <p>To visualise the edition, I chose to use EVT (Edition Visualisation Technology)
                    software. EVT is built for the specific purpose of visualising and publishing
                    TEI-encoded digital scholarly editions, making it a perfect fit for this
                    project. Oxygen has developed default methods of visualising variation between
                    different witnesses, making it straightforward for the user to see and
                    investigate changes between the versions. Moreover, it enables visualisation of
                    deletions and additions within the manuscript, and its customisability allowed
                    for solutions to more complex deletions that span several lines, such as the
                    pencil 'X' in the final stanza of "Dreams". All of these features of EVT helped
                    to contribute to the production of the edition as a usable and informative
                    resource which remains centred on the manuscript while providing different
                    extra-textual information and analysis.</p>
                <h4>Sources used</h4>
                <p>When creating the edition, I used <em>Poems by Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell</em>
                    (1846) as the basis for encoding the editorial variations of this witness within
                    the critical version of the edition. The primary sources I've used are the
                    original Anne Brontë manuscripts. The ten poems are spread across six different
                    manuscripts which are held by three institutions: the Brontë Parsonage Museum,
                    the Morgan Library and Museum and the Berg Collection at the New York Public
                    Library. Permission has kindly been granted to reproduce the images in this
                    edition and the institutions retain copyright over the images of the
                    manuscripts.</p>
