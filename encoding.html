                <h1>Encoding Methodology</h1>
                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p>This digital scholarly edition of a selection of Anne Brontë's poetry has been
                    produced alongside my written thesis on Brontë’s work as part of my PhD project.
                    Anne Brontë's intriguing and layered body of poetry occupies a liminal space
                    within the Brontë family oeuvre, being traditionally overlooked in terms of
                    critical analysis. This edition aims to redress this gap by presenting a
                    manuscript-centred edition accompanied by editorial analysis.</p>
                <p>The following document outlines the methodology used during the creation of this
                    digital scholarly edition of a selection of Brontë's poems. Step by step details
                    about the encoding methodology and process are provided here to document the
                    process of representing and implementing editorial decisions in a digital
                    medium.</p>
                <p>This edition features ten poems with themes relating to my thesis topic of
                    childhood. The poems are presented in two separate editions. One is a diplomatic
                    edition in which full diplomatic transcriptions of the poems are presented
                    alongside the corresponding manuscript images, keeping focus on the texts of the
                    manuscript versions. The critical edition of the poems presents a text which
                    maintains the editorial preference for following the manuscript, but with an
                    interface which provdes users with the option to examine the variations made by
                    Brontë in later published versions.</p>
                <p>The edition was prepared using the Oxygen XML Editor. The critical and diplomatic
                    editions were prepared as separate XML files that adhere to the Text Encoding
                    Initiative Guidelines. This standards-based method ensure platform-independent
                    interoperability of the files and provides flexibility to produce a functional
                    interactive edition that is inviting and user-friendly.</p>
                <p>Definitions of different elements from the official TEI Guidelines have been
                    included where appropriate throughout the document. I have provided links to the
                    relevant sections of the TEI Guidelines, where appropriate.</p>
                <p>Developing a consistent approach to the encoding of the edition was complex at
                    times. There were certain fixed technical requirements, however, at times more
                    creativity was needed to arrive at decisions which were both TEI compliant and
                    achieved the desired visual effect when the edition is rendered online via
                    Edition Visualization Technology (EVT). All of these decisions and methods are
                    outlined here in a step by step guide to the editorial principles and
                    construction of the edition. EVT is "a light-weight, open source tool
                    specifically designed to create digital editions from TEI XML-encoded texts,
                    freeing the scholar from the burden of web programming and enabling the final
                    user to browse, explore and study digital editions by means of a user-friendly
                    interface" (Turco et al).</p>
                <h4>Encoding process</h4>
                <div class="container mt-5">
                    <h5>TEI Header</h5>
                    <p>In order to be compliant with the TEI Guidelines it is necessary to begin all
                        documents with the element <code>&lt;teiHeader&gt;</code>, which must
                        contain certain crucial information about the document, its text/s and
                        encoding. While there are a number of possible elements which can be
                        contained within <code>&lt;teiHeader&gt;</code>, the element
                            <code>&lt;fileDesc&gt;</code> is the only one that is mandatory for all
                        documents. [TEI Guidelines <a
                            href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/HD.html#HD2"

                <div class="container mt-5">
                    <h5>File description</h5>
                    <p>The <code>&lt;fileDesc&gt;</code> element "contains a full bibliographic
                        description of an electronic file" <a
                            href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/HD.html#HD2"
                            >[2.2]</a>. Within this element it is also mandatory to include the
                        following elements : <code>&lt;titleStmt&gt;</code>,
                            <code>&lt;publicationStmt&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;sourceDesc&gt;</code>

                        title of a work and those responsible for its content" <a

                            >[2.2.1]</a>. This must include the title of the file and usually also
                        includes information on the authors and/or editors of the file as well as
                        any other parties who are responsible for the production of the document. </p>

                    <p>Each witness needs to be encoded with a unique @xml:id identifier so that it
                        can be linked to variations within the text. For the printed texts the sigla
                        used were a form of initials for the text e.g. for the 1846 Poems by Currer,
                        Ellis and Acton Bell: <code>&lt;witness xml:id="ACE"&gt;</code></p>
                    <p>For the manuscripts I decided to adopt the sigla used by Edward Chitham in
                        his 1979 comprehensive print edition of The Poems of Anne Brontë (updated
                        and reissued in 2021) to facilitate easy cross-referencing of the
                        manuscripts by readers. For example: <code>&lt;witness
                            xml:id="MS-P"&gt;</code></p>
                    <p>This id was then used when encoding variations to indicate which readings can
                        be found in each witness: <code>&lt;rdg
                        wit="#ACE"&gt;,&lt;/rdg&gt;</code></p>
