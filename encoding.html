                <h1>Encoding Methodology</h1>
                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p>This digital scholarly edition of a selection of Anne Brontë's poetry has been
                    produced alongside my written thesis on Brontë’s work as part of my PhD project.
                    Anne Brontë's intriguing and layered body of poetry occupies a liminal space
                    within the Brontë family oeuvre, being traditionally overlooked in terms of
                    critical analysis. This edition aims to redress this gap by presenting a
                    manuscript-centred edition accompanied by editorial analysis.</p>
                <p>The following document outlines the methodology used during the creation of this
                    digital scholarly edition of a selection of Brontë's poems. Step by step details
                    about the encoding methodology and process are provided here to document the
                    process of representing and implementing editorial decisions in a digital
                    medium.</p>
                <p>This edition features ten poems with themes relating to my thesis topic of
                    childhood. The poems are presented in two separate editions. One is a
                    documentary edition in which full diplomatic transcriptions of the poems are
                    presented alongside the corresponding manuscript images, keeping focus on the
                    texts of the manuscript versions. The critical edition of the poems presents a
                    text which maintains the editorial preference for following the manuscript, but
                    with an interface which provdes users with the option to examine the variations
                    made by Brontë in later published versions.</p>
                <p>The edition was prepared using the Oxygen XML Editor. The critical and
                    documentary editions were prepared as separate XML files that adhere to the Text
                    Encoding Initiative Guidelines. This standards-based method ensure
                    platform-independent interoperability of the files and provides flexibility to
                    produce a functional interactive edition that is inviting and user-friendly.</p>
                <p>Definitions of different elements from the official TEI Guidelines have been
                    included where appropriate throughout the document. I have provided links to the
                    relevant sections of the TEI Guidelines, where appropriate.</p>
                <p>Developing a consistent approach to the encoding of the edition was complex at
                    times. There were certain fixed technical requirements, however, at times more
                    creativity was needed to arrive at decisions which were both TEI compliant and
                    achieved the desired visual effect when the edition is rendered online via
                    Edition Visualization Technology (EVT). All of these decisions and methods are
                    outlined here in a step by step guide to the editorial principles and
                    construction of the edition. EVT is "a light-weight, open source tool
                    specifically designed to create digital editions from TEI XML-encoded texts,
                    freeing the scholar from the burden of web programming and enabling the final
                    user to browse, explore and study digital editions by means of a user-friendly
                    interface" (Turco et al).</p>
                <h4>Encoding process</h4>
                <div class="container mt-5">
                    <h5>TEI Header</h5>
                    <p>In order to be compliant with the TEI Guidelines it is necessary to begin all
                        documents with the element <code>&lt;teiHeader&gt;</code>, which must
                        contain certain crucial information about the document, its text/s and
                        encoding. While there are a number of possible elements which can be
                        contained within <code>&lt;teiHeader&gt;</code>, the element
                            <code>&lt;fileDesc&gt;</code> is the only one that is mandatory for all
                        documents. [TEI Guidelines <a

                    <p>The <code>&lt;fileDesc&gt;</code> element "contains a full bibliographic

                        and reissued in 2021) to facilitate easy cross-referencing of the
                        manuscripts by readers. For example:</p>
                    <pre class="code-block">&lt;witness xml:id="MS-P"&gt;</pre>
                    <p>This id was then used when encoding variations to indicate which readings can
                        be found in each witness:</p>
                    <pre class="code-block">&lt;rdg wit="#ACE"&gt;,&lt;/rdg&gt;</pre>
                </div>
                <div class="container mt-5">
                    <h5>Witness information</h5>
                    <p>When providing information about the text within the <code>&lt;wit&gt;</code>
                        element, I used the <code>&lt;bibl&gt;</code> element to group relevant
                        bibliographic information about the witnesses.</p>
                    <p>For manuscripts, this includes the manuscript title, with information about
                        the repository where the manuscript is housed and its catalogue number
                        included within the <code>&lt;msIdentifier&gt;</code> element:</p>

                    <h5>Texts</h5>
                    <p>Each poem was initially encoded in its own TEI XML document to allow for ease
                        of testing features in Edition Visualisation Technology (EVT) software.
                        These individual files were them combined into one complete file for the
                        documentary version and a second for the critical version of the
                        edition.</p>
                    <p>Each poem in the combined file is encoded in a separate
                            <code>&lt;text&gt;</code> element. In order to link the poem to images
                        of the manuscripts they need to be identified as separate texts within the
                        final document. Therefore, each poem’s title is recorded with the
                            <code>@n</code> attribute and given a unique <code>@xml:id</code> which
                        is a contraction of the poem’s name. This information is recorded within the
                            <code>&lt;text&gt;</code> element to ensure that the entire poem is
                        correctly recorded as a discrete text:</p>
                    <pre class="code-block">&lt;text n="Tis Strange to think" xml:id="TIS"&gt;</pre>

                    <h5>Front matter and titles</h5>
                    <p>After the <code>&lt;text&gt;</code> element the encoding of the poem itself
                        can begin. The first aspect of the poem to consider is the title of the
                        poem. The preferred method of encoding paratextual information such as the
                        title or information on a title page is by tagging it with the
                            <code>&lt;front&gt;</code> element which "contains any prefatory matter
                        (headers, abstracts, title page, prefaces, dedications, etc.) found at the
                        start of a document, before the main body" <a
                            href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/DS.html#DSTITL"
                            >[4.6]</a>.</p>
                    <p>Within the <code>&lt;front&gt;</code> element the correct choice for encoding
                        the poem’s title is the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element which "contains
                        any type of heading, for example the title of a section, or the heading of a
                        list, glossary, manuscript description, etc." <a

                    <p>An example would look as follows:</p>
                    <pre class="code-block">
&lt;front&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;Tis Strange to Think&lt;/head&gt;

                    <h5>Text body</h5>
                    <p>After the completion of the <code>&lt;front&gt;</code> element, the text of
                        the poem is encoded within a <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element. The text
                        body element “contains the whole body of a single unitary text, excluding
                        any front or back matter” <a

                <div class="container mt-5">
                    <h5>Manuscript images</h5>
                    <p>The edition features parallel images of the manuscripts alongside
                        transcriptions of the text. Therefore, images of the manuscript need to be
                        linked to the texts so that EVT will recognise which images to display.</p>
                    <p>The first step for this process is to give each image a unique filename using
                        an <code>@xml:id</code> attribute. This way, once the image with the
                        corresponding filename is placed in the relevant data folder of EVT
                        (\data\images\single), the software will recognise the link and display the
                        appropriate image. The <code>@xml:id</code> attribute is placed within a
                            <code>&lt;pb/&gt;</code> element, which indicates a page break. This
                        allows the images and the text to become fully linked so that turning the
                        virtual page of the manuscript will lead to the appropriate portion of
                        transcribed text appearing on screen. Therefore, at every change of image a
                        new numbered <code>&lt;pb&gt;</code> element indicates which image should be
                        displayed.</p>
                    <p>For example, the first instance of page-image alignment in a document might
                        be encoded as follows:</p>
                    <pre class="code-block">&lt;pb n="1" xml:id="TIS_1" facs="data/images/single/TIS_1.jpg/&gt;</pre>
                    <p>With "TIS_1" referring to the image file "TIS_1.jpg" housed in the relevant
                        EVT data folder.</p>
                    <p>A subsequent change of image would then look like this:</p>
                    <pre class="code-block">&lt;pb n="2" xml:id="TIS_2" facs="data/images/single/TIS_2.jpg/&gt;</pre>

                    <h5>Text structure</h5>
                    <p>When encoding the poems, there are some benefits to signifying changes in
                        stanzas. Both <code>&lt;lg&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> would
                        work in this capacity, however EVT’s default configuration did not recognise
                            <code>&lt;lg&gt;</code> as a discrete stanza so I decided to use
                            <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> as follows:</p>
                    <pre class="code-block">&lt;div type="stanza"&gt;</pre>
                    <p>This allows the poem to render correctly in EVT without additional
                        customisation and clearly demarcates between different stanzas while using
                        valid TEI markup.</p>
                    <p>I decided to label and number each individual line of poetry within each
                        text. This makes it straightforward to find and refer to verse lines and is
                        the preferred practice for using EVT. This method also generates the line
                        numbering-feature in EVT:</p>
                    <pre class="code-block">&lt;l n="26"&gt;Upon whose changeful face&lt;/l&gt;</pre>
                    <p>Line numbering caused some complications when creating the critical version
                        of some poems which include full line deletions within the manuscript.

                <div class="container mt-5">
                    <h5>Deletions and additions</h5>
                    <p>Deletions and additions are a significant feature of interest when creating
                        the edition. By examining the changes Brontë is making on the page I can
                        illuminate and analyse the conscious development of her critical and poetic
                        voice.</p>
                    <p>In the documentary edition, the recommended approach for a deletion is to use
                        the <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> element which "contains a letter, word, or
                        passage deleted, marked as deleted, or otherwise indicated as superfluous or
                        spurious in the copy text by an author, scribe, or a previous annotator or
                        corrector" <a
                            href="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/CO.html#COEDADD"
                            >[3.5.3]</a>. Within EVT this element is visualised as a strikethrough
                        which accurately fits Brontë's authorial habit of striking through deleted
                        words.</p>
                    <p>For words added by Brontë above the main line of the text,
                            <code>&lt;add&gt;</code> was used. This element "contains letters,
                        words, or phrases inserted in the source text by an author, scribe, or a
                        previous annotator or corrector" <a
                            href="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/CO.html#COEDADD"
                            >[3.5.3]</a> and EVT displays the encoded text above the line. </p>
                    <p>Deletions and above-line additions often feature in pairs within the
                        manuscripts, here is an example of the encoding within the documentary
                        edition, where Brontë deleted the word "peace" and replaced it with the word
                        "bliss" above the line:</p>
                    <pre class="code-block">
&lt;l n="170"&gt;And &lt;del&gt;peace&lt;/del&gt;
    &lt;add&gt;bliss&lt;/add&gt; shall rule for evermore&lt;/l&gt;</pre>
                    <p>A different approach was needed within the critical edition as the deletions
                        and additions only apply to the MS, meaning that just
                            <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;add&gt;</code> by itself could
                        give the impression that the feature occurs in all versions of the text.
                        Therefore, in the critical version I decided to nest these features within
                        the critical apparatus encoding framework of <code>&lt;app&gt;</code> and
                            <code>&lt;lem&gt;</code>, to make it clear that the changes only relate
                        to one specific witness.</p>
                    <p>Here is an example of a deletion within the critical version:</p>
                    <pre class="code-block">
&lt;app&gt;
    &lt;lem wit="#MS-P"&gt;
        &lt;del&gt;songs&lt;/del&gt;
    &lt;/lem&gt;
&lt;/app&gt;</pre>

                <div class="container mt-5">
                    <h5>Emphasis</h5>
                    <p>At times Brontë underlines certain words within her manuscripts. In printed
                        texts this usually corresponds to the capitalisation of the words.</p>
                    <p>In order to accurately convey this phenomenon within the manuscript, the most
                        effective element is <code>&lt;hi&gt;</code> which "marks a word or phrase
                        as graphically distinct from the surrounding text" <a
                            href="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/CO.html#COHQHE"
                            >[3.3.2.2]</a>.</p>
                    <p>This leads EVT to render the text as underlined, ensuring that the text is
                        accurate and the reader can see the additional emphasis relating to the word
                        in question. An example:</p>
                    <pre class="code-block">&lt;hi rend="underline"&gt;will&lt;/hi&gt;</pre>
                </div>
                <div class="container mt-5">
                    <h5>Extra-texual manuscript information</h5>
                    <p>Brontë often records the poem’s total number of lines somewhere within the
                        manuscript, most often on either the first or final page. As it is often
                        placed in isolation rather than as part of a particular pre-existing element
                        of text, I use the anonymous block element, <code>&lt;ab&gt;</code>, in the
                        relevant location to record these notes. This element "contains any
                        component-level unit of text, acting as a container for phrase or inter
                        level elements analogous to, but without the same constraints as, a
                        paragraph" <a

                            >[17.3]</a>, making it flexible for this use-case. For example:</p>
                    <pre class="code-block">&lt;ab&gt;24 lines&lt;/ab&gt;</pre>
                    <p>Many of Anne Brontë's manuscripts include a signature and date after the
                        poem. In order to record this information in the document while demarcating
                        it from the body of the poem I opted for the <code>&lt;closer&gt;</code>
                        element after the text of the poem. This element "groups together
                        salutations, datelines, and similar phrases appearing as a final group at
                        the end of a division, especially of a letter" <a

                            >[4.2.2]</a>.</p>
                    <p>The <code>&lt;closer&gt;</code> is contained within a
                            <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element so that EVT is able to correctly
                        process the text of the closer as a discrete and valid portion of text.</p>
                    <p>Within the <code>&lt;closer&gt;</code> element, the signature is then
                        indicated with a <code>&lt;signed&gt;</code> element while a date is
                        included in the <code>&lt;dateline&gt;</code> element. For example:</p>
                    <pre class="code-block">

    &lt;closer&gt;
        &lt;signed&gt;A B&lt;/signed&gt;

                        versions of the texts produced by Brontë to get a sense of how later
                        editions of the poem differ from the original manuscript. These changes
                        often comprise spelling changes and punctuation, although substantive
                        textual changes also occur and provide valuable insights into Brontë's
                        literary, philosophical and aesthetic approach.</p>
                    <p>All variations between the witnesses are recorded in an
                            <code>&lt;app&gt;</code> element. The <code>&lt;app&gt;</code> element
                        "contains one entry in a critical apparatus, with an optional lemma and
                        usually one or more readings or notes on the relevant passage" <a
                            href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/TC.html#TCAPEN"
                            >[13.1.1]</a>.</p>
                    <p>This edition is one that foregrounds the manuscript because part of the
                        function of creating this digital edition is to provide direct access to
                        Brontë's original versions of these poems for the first time by including
                        images of original manuscripts. This gives the edition user the opportunity
                        to encounter important manuscript features such as Brontë's original
                        punctuation and crucial revisions in an immediate and unfiltered way.</p>
                    <p>The critical edition also includes the 1846 versions of the texts. This
                        version presents the user with the evolution of the poem's texts,
                        illuminating the textual history of the poems.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, it was appropriate to designate <code>&lt;lem&gt;</code> as
                        referring to manuscripts as <code>&lt;lem&gt;</code> "contains the lemma, or
                        base text, of a textual variation" <a
                            href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/TC.html#TCAPLL"
                            >[1.1]</a>. Meanwhile, the variant readings from 1846 Poems are
                        indicated by <code>&lt;rdg&gt;</code> which "contains a single reading
                        within a textual variation" <a
                            href="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/TC.html#TCAPLL"
                            >[12.1]</a></p>
                    <p>A typical <code>&lt;app&gt;</code> in which there are different readings
                        between the MS and other witness is encoded as follows:</p>
                    <pre class="code-block">
&lt;l n="21"&gt;When &lt;app&gt;
        &lt;lem wit="#MS-Q"&gt;friendly intercourse&lt;/lem&gt;
        &lt;rdg wit="#ACE"&gt;speech and mirth at once&lt;/rdg&gt;
    &lt;/app&gt;
&lt;/l&gt;</pre>
                    <p>Where a word or punctuation mark is not present in all versions of the text
                        then only those witnesses which do include a feature in that textual
                        position are included within the <code>&lt;app&gt;</code>.</p>
                    <p>For example:</p>
                    <pre class="code-block">
&lt;l n="28"&gt;… might trace&lt;app&gt;
        &lt;rdg wit="#ACE"&gt;;&lt;/rdg&gt;
    &lt;/app&gt;
&lt;/l&gt;</pre>

                    <h5>Editorial notes</h5>
                    <p>The <code>&lt;note&gt;</code> element is the obvious choice for inline notes.
                        The element "contains a note or annotation" <a
                            href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/CO.html#CONONO"
                            >[3.9.1]</a> that renders as an interactable coloured dot similar to an
                        asterisk within EVT, allowing extra information to be provided without
                        unduly cluttering the reading view of the poems.</p>
                    <p>It has been used throughout the edition to highlight or expand on interesting
                        features of the MS. The content comprises of concise comments on MS
                        deletions or rewrites or relevant extra-textual info such as title
                        changes.</p>
                    <p>For example:</p>
                    <pre class="code-block">
&lt;note&gt;This poem is entitled "A Fragment" in both the MS and Chitham and was named
    "Self-Congratulation" in 1846 Poems.&lt;/note&gt;</pre>
                    <p>More significant editorial commentary has been included in individual
                        editor's provided at the bottom of each poem. Placed after the text of the
                        poem and the inclusion of closing info this info is nested within a new
                            <code>&lt;div type="editor’s_note"&gt;</code>.</p>
                    <p>There is then a <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element to allow me to title the
                        note in a way that is visible to the reader. Finally the text of the note
                        itself is contained within <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element which "marks
                        paragraphs in prose" <a
                            href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/CO.html#COPA"
                            >[3.1]</a> These choices ensure that change in author and type of
                        information here is made clear both for the internal working of the xml file
                        and for the user of the edition.</p>
                    <p>Here is an example:</p>
                    <pre class="code-block">
&lt;div type="editor’s_note"&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;Editor's Note&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; This 1838 poem is an early Gondal poem exploring themes of family, regret and nostalgia and
        was not published during Bronte's lifetime. (…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
                    <p>In terms of content, each note provides some background to the textual
                        history of the poem, including information on the composition, manuscript
                        location and whether they were published by Brontë herself or posthumously.
                        I then provide concise critical summaries of each poem before highlighting
                        and analysing the most striking features of the MS and/or revisions to the
                        1846 publications.</p>
