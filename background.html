                <h1>Background</h1>
                <h4 id="Biography">Biography</h4>
                <p>Anne Brontë was born in Bradford in 1820 as the youngest of six children to
                    Patrick and Maria Brontë. Along with her surviving sisters Charlotte and Emily,
                    Anne became an author of fiction and poetry. The Brontë family gained an
                    important position within the canon of Victorian fiction, although Anne’s work
                    has traditionally been left on the margins.</p>
                <p>After the early death of her mother, Anne was close to her maternal Aunt
                    Branwell, from whom she developed a deep religious ethic and her own deep
                    personal belief in universal salvation. Unlike her older sisters, Anne was too
                    young to attend the infamous Cowan Bridge school where her eldest two sisters
                    both became terminally ill and was educated at home in Haworth until attending
                    boarding school in her teens.</p>
                <p>As young children Anne and her sister Emily created an imaginary world called
                    Gondal. This fantasy setting influences much of Brontë’s poetry which was often
                    written from these creative heightened scenarios.</p>
                <p>Anne worked as a governess, most significantly with the Robinson family for five
                    years. She only left the Robinsons after her brother Branwell (who was working
                    as a tutor for the family on Anne’s recommendation) caused a scandal by having
                    an affair with the married Lady Robinson. Nevertheless, Anne remained friends
                    with her students throughout the remainder of her life.</p>
                <p>After returning to Haworth, Anne worked with her sisters Charlotte and Emily on
                    shared goals of literary publishing. The three sisters self-funded the
                    publication of a volume of poetry in 1846. Following this, Emily and Anne’s
                    first novels, <em>Agnes Grey</em> and <em>Wuthering Heights</em>, were accepted
                    for publication, eventually being published in Autumn 1847. Anne then followed
                    up with <em>The Tenant of Wildfell Hall</em> in 1848.</p>
                <p>Anne Brontë’s fiction is characterised by a dauntless confrontation of societal
                    abuses which was met with a mixed reception, particularly <em>The Tenant of
                        Wildfell Hall</em>’s startlingly modern portrayal of coercive control in a
                    marriage. Anne was stalwart in her defence of her novel, penning a fiery preface
                    to its second edition, and travelling to London to boldly declare her identity
                    after confusion over the sisters’ pseudonyms caused conflicts between sister’s
                    different publishers. This unabashed conviction has since been recognised as her
                    greatest strength with the recovery of her critical reputation, pushing back on
                    her traditional cultural image as the quiet, shy Brontë sister.</p>
                <p>After tragedy struck the family with the successive shocking premature deaths of
                    Branwell and Emily, Anne’s health deteriorated, and she ultimately passed away
                    in June 1849 at the age of 29. She persuaded Charlotte to bring her to
                    Scarborough in her last weeks, with a final hope in the curative powers of the
                    sea air expressed in her letter to their friend Ellen Nussey who accompanied
                    them. She is the only Brontë not to be buried in the Haworth cemetery as befits
                    her outward looking gaze.</p>
                <h4 id="publishing-history">Publishing history of Anne Brontë’s poetry</h4>
                <p>A selection of Anne Brontë’s poems were included by the sisters in their joint
                    poetry collection <em>Poems by Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell</em> which was
                    published by Aylott and Jones with self-financing by the sisters in 1846. One of
                    Anne’s poems, “The Narrow Way”, was published by <em>Fraser's Magazine</em> in
                    1847, the only Brontë poem to be published independently during their lifetimes.
                    After Anne’s death Charlotte published another ten of her poems as part of the
                        <em>Selections from the Literary Remains of Ellis and Acton Bell</em>, in
                    some cases with significant changes. The rest were published by various other
                    editors in the later 19th and early 20th century before being brought all
                    together in Chitham’s 1979 edition of <em>The Poems of Anne Brontë</em> (updated
                    and republished in 2021).</p>
