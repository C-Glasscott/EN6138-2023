                </figure>
                <p>Anne Brontë was born in Bradford in 1820 as the youngest of six children to
                    Patrick and Maria Brontë. Along with her surviving sisters Charlotte and Emily,
                    Anne became an author of fiction and poetry.</p>
                <p>After the early death of her mother, Anne was close to her maternal Aunt
                    Branwell, from whom she developed a deep religious ethic and her own deep
                    personal belief in universal salvation. Unlike her older sisters, Anne was too
                    young to attend the infamous Cowan Bridge school where her eldest two sisters
                    both became terminally ill and was educated at home in Haworth until attending
                    boarding school in her teens.</p>
                <p>As young children Anne and her sister Emily created an imaginary world called
                    Gondal. This fantasy setting influences much of Brontë’s poetry which was often
                    based upon these creative heightened scenarios.</p>
                <p>Anne worked as a governess, most significantly with the Robinson family for five
                    years. She only left the Robinsons after her brother Branwell (who was working
                    as a tutor for the family on Anne’s recommendation) caused a scandal by having
                    an affair with the married Lady Robinson. Nevertheless, Anne remained friends
                    with her students throughout the remainder of her life.</p>
                <p>After returning to Haworth, Anne worked with her sisters Charlotte and Emily on
                    shared goals of literary publishing. The three sisters self-funded the
                    publication of a volume of poetry in 1846. Following this, Emily and Anne’s
                    first novels, <em>Agnes Grey</em> and <em>Wuthering Heights</em>, were accepted
                    for publication, eventually being published in Autumn 1847. Anne then followed
                    up with <em>The Tenant of Wildfell Hall</em> in 1848.</p>
                <p>Anne Brontë's fiction is characterised by a dauntless confrontation of societal
                    abuses and met with a mixed reception, particularly <em>The Tenant of Wildfell
                        Hall</em>'s startlingly modern portrayal of coercive control in a marriage.
                    Anne was stalwart in her defence of her novel, penning a fiery preface to its
                    second edition, and travelling to London to boldly declare her identity after
                    confusion over the sisters’ pseudonyms caused conflicts between their different
                    publishers. With the growth of her critical reputation, this unabashed
                    conviction has since been recognised as her greatest strength, pushing back on
                    her traditional cultural image as the quiet, shy Brontë sister.</p>
                <p>After tragedy struck the family with the successive shocking premature deaths of
                    Branwell and Emily, Anne’s health deteriorated, and she ultimately passed away
                    in June 1849 at the age of 29. She persuaded Charlotte to bring her to
                    Scarborough in her last weeks, with a final hope in the curative powers of the
                    sea air expressed in her letter to their friend Ellen Nussey who accompanied
                    them (Smith 544-45). She is the only Brontë not to be buried in the Haworth cemetery as
                    befits her outward looking gaze.</p>

                <p>A selection of sixteen of Anne Brontë's poems were included by the sisters in
                    their joint poetry collection <em>Poems by Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell</em>
                    which was published by Aylott and Jones with self-financing by the sisters in
                    1846. The four of Anne's Gondal poems which were included in this edition ("A
                    Fragment", "Parting address from Z.Z to A.E", "The Consolation" &amp; "The
                    Student’s Serenade") had their Gondal signatures removed, along with some
                    updating of language and phrasing. The suppression of the fantastical elements
                    of the Gondal poems serves to give her contribution a more uniform presentation
                    as a set of lyric poems, many of which mediate on themes of faith. Two of Anne's
                    poems, "The Narrow Way" and "The Three Guides" were published by <em>Fraser's
                        Magazine</em> in 1848, the only two Brontë poems to be published
                    independently during their lifetimes.</p>
                <p>After Anne's death Charlotte published another ten of her sister's poems as part
                    of the <em>Selections from the Literary Remains of Ellis and Acton Bell</em>, in
                    some cases with significant changes. Most notably, her final poem was published
                    as "Last Lines" in a shortened and rearranged version of the original manuscript
                    text. The rest were published by various other editors in the later nineteenth
                    and early twentieth century before being brought together in a complete
                    collection in Edward Chitham's 1979 edition of <em>The Poems of Anne Brontë</em>
                    (updated and republished in 2021). Within Chitham's edition the text of the
                    poems is "derived from a series of fair-copy MSS" (192). Chitham follows the
                    manuscripts on titles and "indentation and line division" while "[s]pelling is
                    modernised with manuscript divergence given in footnotes" (xix).</p>
