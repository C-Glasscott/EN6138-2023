        <p>The time is ripe to bring more public and critical attention to Anne Brontë's poetry.
          This scholarly digital edition provides access to newly edited digital texts of ten of
          Brontë's poems. Manuscript images of these poems are brought together from a range of
          international institutions, providing direct access to Brontë's work. Brontë's poetry is
          historically overlooked within her oeuvre. Brontë herself was traditionally positioned as
          the 'third' Brontë, with her work being deemed less worthy of critical attention. Much
          work has been done to shift this focus in recent decades, building up from the feminist
          reclamation of her much maligned second novel <em>The Tenant of Wildfell Hall</em> of the
          1980s to a purposeful reframing of Anne Brontë's status as an important Victorian novelist
          in her own right in the 21st century.</p>
        <p>Despite these changes to Brontë's reputation, the lack of rigorous scholarly research
          centring on her poetry stands out as a glaring omission, with the troubling tendency to
          focus on autobiographical readings undermining readings of Brontë's poetry as a crucial
          component of her literary project. This trend is in keeping with critical dismissals of
          women's lyric poetry as sentimental. Anne Brontë's poetry crosses genres, with much of her
          early work taking place in the fantasy world of Gondal that she created with her sister
          Emily as children. Even as Anne developed other modes of poetry, she continued to
          regularly write Gondal poems, using it as a vehicle from which to explore complicated
          social and emotional issues in innovative and insightful ways. This edition refocuses
          attention on Anne Brontë as a poet by providing access to and commentary on her
          manuscripts.</p>
        <p>This site presents two separate editions of these poems. One is a documentary edition in
          which full diplomatic transcriptions of the poems are presented alongside the
          corresponding manuscript images, keeping focus on the texts of the manuscript versions.
          The critical edition of the poems presents a text which maintains the editorial
          preference for following the manuscript, but with an interface which provdes users with
          the option to examine the variations made by Brontë in later published versions. The
          critical edition provides additional context about the publishing history of each poem and
          critical commentary elucidating Brontë’s creative process at work, highlighting and
          analysing changes to the manuscript or between the manuscript and the later versions
          published by Brontë. This combined editorial method reveals intriguing new insights into
          the development of Brontë's philosophical and literary approach.</p>
        <p>This edition is part of my PhD project <em>Representations of childhood in the work of
            Anne Brontë</em>. The thesis is a close study of Brontë's engagement with the concept of
          childhood across her oeuvre, paying particular attention to her positioning on questions
          of pedagogical practice and Romanticism. This edition focuses on Brontë's poems involving
          childhood. This focus results in a spread of poems from early to more mature work and
          includes both Gondal and non-Gondal poetry. The changes made within the manuscripts and
          between versions contribute further, by highlighting easily overlooked features of
          Brontë's positioning on the topics of childhood, motherhood and Romanticism. The framing
          of childhood is also a central question within both of her novels, <em>Agnes Grey</em> and
            <em>The Tenant of Wildfell Hall</em> as both focus on education as a means of enacting
          societal reform. By introducing Anne Brontë’s understudied poetry into this important and
          complicated dialogue, the production of this edition adds valuable context to our
          understanding of her literary project.</p>
